title Orchestrator vs Aggregate Root: Who Calls What?

participant "PortfolioStockOperationsService\n(Application Service)" as Service #LightBlue
participant "Portfolio\n(Aggregate Root)" as Portfolio #LightGreen
participant "Holding\n(Entity)" as Holding #LightYellow
participant "Lot\n(Entity)" as Lot #LightYellow

== ✅ Correct: Service calls Aggregate Root ==

Service -> Portfolio: sell(ticker, quantity, price)
activate Service
activate Portfolio
note right of Service
  Application Service
  **orchestrates** but
  does NOT make
  business decisions
end note

Portfolio -> Portfolio: validate inputs
Portfolio -> Portfolio: check holdings exist
Portfolio -> Holding: sell(quantity, price)
activate Holding
note right of Portfolio
  Aggregate Root
  **protects invariants**
  and delegates to
  controlled entities
end note

Holding -> Holding: check total shares
Holding -> Lot: reduce(qty)
activate Lot
Lot -> Lot: validate & update
Lot --> Holding: void
deactivate Lot

Holding -> Holding: calculate profit
Holding --> Portfolio: SellResult
deactivate Holding

Portfolio -> Portfolio: update balance
Portfolio --> Service: SellResult
deactivate Portfolio
deactivate Service

== ❌ WRONG: Service directly manipulating entities ==

Service -[#red]x Holding: <font color=red>getLots()</font>
activate Service
activate Holding #Pink
note right of Service #Pink
  <font color=red>**ANTI-PATTERN!**</font>
  
  Service should NEVER
  directly manipulate
  entities inside the
  aggregate!
end note
Holding -[#red]-> Service: <font color=red>List<Lot></font>
deactivate Holding

Service -[#red]x Lot: <font color=red>reduce(qty)</font>
activate Lot #Pink
note right of Service #Pink
  This bypasses the
  aggregate root!
  
  Invariants can be
  violated!
end note
Lot -[#red]-> Service: <font color=red>void</font>
deactivate Lot
deactivate Service

note over Service, Lot
  **DDD Rule:**
  External code (including application services)
  must ONLY call methods on the aggregate root.
  
  Nested entities are **controlled** by the root.
