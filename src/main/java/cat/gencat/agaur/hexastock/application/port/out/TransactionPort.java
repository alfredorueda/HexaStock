/**
 * TransactionPort defines the secondary port for transaction persistence operations.
 * 
 * <p>In hexagonal architecture terms, this is a <strong>secondary port</strong> (output port)
 * that defines how the application core communicates with the persistence layer for
 * financial transaction records. It is implemented by driven adapters that connect to 
 * actual database systems.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This generic interface allows the application to:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Abstract away the details of how transactions are stored and retrieved</li>
 *   <li>Support multiple storage technologies without changing the application core</li>
 *   <li>Facilitate testing by allowing mock implementations</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The port handles the core transaction persistence operations needed by the application:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Retrieving transaction history for a specific portfolio</li>
 *   <li>Saving new transaction records when financial activities occur</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The generic type parameter &lt;T&gt; allows flexibility in how transactions are represented
 * when retrieved from persistence, while ensuring type safety.</p>
