/**
 * SaleResponseDTO is a Data Transfer Object for returning stock sale results in the REST API.
 * 
 * <p>In hexagonal architecture terms, this is part of the <strong>primary adapter</strong> layer,
 * used to transfer data between the domain model and the external world. It wraps the domain
 * SellResult object to expose it to API consumers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This DTO encapsulates information about a stock sale, including:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The proceeds from the sale (total money received)</li>
 *   <li>The cost basis (original purchase cost of the sold shares)</li>
 *   <li>The profit or loss from the sale</li>
 *   <li>The portfolio ID associated with the sale</li>
 *   <li>The ticker symbol of the stock</li>
 *   <li>The quantity of shares sold</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>This information is crucial for users to understand the financial impact of their stock sales,
 * particularly for calculating taxes and tracking investment performance.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As a record, this class is immutable and provides built-in value semantics,
 * which is ideal for DTOs that should not be modified after creation.</p>
